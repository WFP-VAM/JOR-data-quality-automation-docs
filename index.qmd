## 🏗️ Application Architecture

The application uses a **registry-based system** where exercises are automatically discovered and loaded from the `app/exercises/` directory.

```{mermaid}
#| echo: false
#| eval: false
graph TB
    A[Main App<br/>app.r] --> B[Exercise Registry<br/>exercise_registry.r]
    B --> C[Exercise 1]
    B --> D[Exercise 2]
    B --> E[Exercise N]
    C --> F[Reusable Components]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[Validation Rules]
    F --> H[UI Components]
    F --> I[Helper Functions]
```

### Core Components

#### Exercise Files (`app/exercises/*.r`)
Each exercise is self-contained with metadata, data fetching, validation rules, and visualizations.

#### Validation Rules (`app/R/validation_rules.r`)
Reusable validation functions including duration checks, submission validations, and data quality rules.

#### Visualization Helpers (`app/R/visualization_helpers.r`)
Pre-built UI components for metrics, breakdowns, and dashboards.
